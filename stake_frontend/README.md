## About My Frontend Skills

I specialize in blockchain development and backend engineering. Over the years, I have gained extensive experience in building smart contracts, creating relayers, and developing APIs for decentralized applications. My strength lies in integrating these backend services with front-end frameworks rather than building the front-end from scratch.

While I have knowledge of front-end integration and have successfully connected front-end applications with smart contracts in past projects, I do not focus on designing or developing full-fledged front-end interfaces. My contribution is primarily on:

- Writing and deploying smart contracts.
- Building and maintaining backend services and APIs.
- Integrating blockchain functionalities with front-end applications through frameworks like React or libraries like Wagmi or ethers.js.

I prefer to focus on areas where I can deliver the most valueâ€”backend logic, blockchain integration, and ensuring seamless communication between the blockchain and user interfaces.
